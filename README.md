## Hi, I'm Aslan Bennington-Barr!
I love to program, and learn about intriguing algorithms and programming methods.

I am a student at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. I add to my GitHub somewhat irregularly, but I am trying to be more active and consistent.

I am always looking to learn and develop my skills, to help contribute to creating a better world through technology.

## Experience
