## Hi, I'm Aslan Bennington-Barr!
I'm a software hobbyist and developer. I want to improve everyone's everyday experiences by creating tools that make life easier.

## Project Highlights
I'm focusing on my personal information management tool, [My Simple Priorities](https://github.com/BionicCat27/My-Simple-Priorities-Web).
Here are a couple of my other tools:
- [WallpaperManager](https://github.com/BionicCat27/WallpaperManager)
- [House Calculator](https://github.com/BionicCat27/HouseCalculator)
- [Doomsday Calculator](https://github.com/BionicCat27/Doomsday-Calculator-Web)
Here is my Advent of Code portfolio:
